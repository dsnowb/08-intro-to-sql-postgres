# Kilovolt Blog

**Author**: David and Ahmed
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog. The goal is to create a blog that is mobile first, but built to scale using responsive web design techniques, supplying the viewer with a clean, navigable, legible interface, built to comp.

## Getting Started
Download the source code, install node.js and npm, run `npm i` from in the source code directory, then run `node server.js` from within the source code directory. The site will be served at port 3000 on that machine.

## Architecture
HTML for structure and content, CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionality, jQuery for a layer of abstraction on top of JS. Designed using a Mobile First, RWD philosophy with SMACCS and MVC thinking directing the organization of the files. Node.js and Express.js, with Postgres for a DBMS power the backend.

## Change Log
19 Jan 2018 11:21PST - Finished initial build.

## Credits and Collaborations
Node.js and Express.js and Postgres have been essential, as well as the actual code creators.
